Description: The package is focused on finding differential 
   exon usage using RNA-seq exon counts between samples with 
   different experimental designs. It provides functions that 
   allows the user to make the necessary statistical tests based 
   on a model that uses the negative binomial distribution to 
   estimate the variance between biological replicates and 
   generalized linear models for testing. The package also 
   provides functions for the visualization and exploration of 
   the results.
